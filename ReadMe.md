# Mimetrik Solutions Ltd - Technical Task - Unit Test & CI/CD Implementation
## Introduction
Enclosed is one of our small utility library projects, called "FacebowFileReader", which is just a reader class for one of our custom file formats (.mfba). It also contains an example in main.cpp.

There is also a sample .mfba file enclosed.

For completeness I've also attached two pages from our docs on the mfba file format, but I don't think that those are needed.

On your on-site visit, we would like you to walk us through your solution, thought processes, discuss what worked and what perhaps didn't work, how you'd proceed from there, etc.

Lastly I want to say on behalf of all of us at Mimetrik that we see this task/exercise as both an opportunity for us to get to know your skills and working practice better, as well as for you to get an idea of the sort of tasks that we'd envisage you'd do if you were to join us.

## Task 1 - Unit Tests

Your first task would be to write a set of unit tests that test the functionality and correctness of the FacebowFileReader - what, the number of tests, and the unit test framework is left up to your judgement.

Existing source code files should not be changed.

## Task 2 - CI Integration

Write a CI script that automatically runs these tests on a CI system/portal of your choice.
